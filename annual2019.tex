\section{A. 研究概要}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item {\bf Homogeneous H\'enon type elliptic equations with critical Sobolev growth~[2]~[3]} \\
  I worked on the following
  homogeneous H\'enon type elliptic equations with critical Sobolev growth:
  $- \Delta u = \lambda \Psi u + \lvert x \rvert^\alpha u^{2^*-1}$,
  where
  $\Psi$ is a given non-trivial bounded function which may vanish on the bounded boundary. I proved that there exists a positive solution if $\alpha > 0$ is sufficiently small for the dimension $N \geq 4$ by developing new families of test Talenti functions properly. It is known that there is another result for $N = 3$. Thus this seems to be the best result for this type of estimates.
  \item {\bf Kirchhoff-H\'enon type equations with critical Sobolev growth~[1]~[2]} \\
  I applied these new families of functions above for the following Kirchhoff type equations with critical Sobolev growth:
  $- \left( a + b \left\| Du \right\|^{p-2}_{L^2(\Omega)} \right) \Delta u = \Psi u^{q-1} + \lvert x \rvert^\alpha u^{2^* - 1}$.
  Kirchhoff-H\'enon type equations had not been ever studied before my work. In addition, though the standard Kirchhoff type equations are for the case $\alpha = 0$ and $p = 4$, my study covers the case $\alpha > 0$ and $2 < p < q < 2^*$ for the dimension $N \geq 3$. I introduced a new method to obtain estimates of the minimax energy where the fibering map cannot be explicitly represented, and proved the existence of a positive solution for small $\alpha \geq 0$.
  \item {\bf Stand wave solutions of
  nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson systems~[9]} \\
  This is a joint work with Hiroyuki Miyahara (UTokyo).
  We worked on stand wave solutions
  of the following nonhomogeneous
  nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson systems:
  $-\Delta u -a \phi \left\lvert u \right\rvert^{q-1} u = \lambda u
  + b \left\lvert u \right\rvert^{p-1} u, -\Delta \phi =
  \left\lvert u \right\rvert^{q+1}$.
  There were many previous studies for the case the dimension $N = 3$,
  but our study covered the case $N \geq 3$.
  We proved existence and nonexistence theorem
  where each $p, q+1$ is critical or subcritical.
  Especially, for some specific case,
  we determined the range of $\lambda$ where a non-trivial solution
  $(u, \phi)$ does exist or does not exist.
  \item {\bf Generalized Joseph-Lundgren exponent~[5]} \\
  This is a joint work with Prof.~Yasuhito Miyamoto (UTokyo).
  We worked on the following ordinary differential equation for $r
  \in (0, \infty)$:
  $r^{-(\gamma-1)} (r^\alpha \lvert u' \rvert^{\beta -1 } u')'
  + \lvert u \rvert^{p-1} u = 0$.
  Here the left term represents
  a generalized radial differential operator
  that covers, for example, the $N$-dimensional
  usual Laplacian, $m$-Laplacian or $k$-Hessian.
  In previous research
  the generalized Joseph-Lundgren exponent for this operator
  was calculated, but there was a technical lowerbound for
  the exponent $p$.
  We removed that bound by transforming the equation
  and determined intersection numbers
  which role differently on $p$.
  \item {\bf Nonhomogeneous semilinear elliptic equations involving
  critical Sobolev exponent~[6]~[10]} \\
  I worked on the following
  nonhomogeneous semilinear elliptic equation
  involving the critical Sobolev exponent:
  $-\Delta u + a u = b u^{2^* - 1} + \lambda f$.
  I proved that provided
  $b$ achieves its maximum at an inner point of the
  domain and $a$ has a growth of the exponent $q$
  in some neighborhood of that point, then
  if the dimension of the domain is less than $6 + 2q$,
  there exist at least two positive solutions.
  It seems to be new that the coefficient of a linear term affects
  the dimension of the domain on which solutions exist.
  \item {\bf Zero-dimensional fold and cut~[4]~[7]} \\
  This is a joint work with
  Yasuhiko Asao (UTokyo), Prof.~Erik D.~Demaine (MIT),
  Prof.~Martin L.~Demaine (MIT), Hideaki Hosaka (Azabu high school),
  Prof.~Akitoshi Kawamura (UTokyo)
  and Prof.~Tomohiro Tachi (UTokyo).
  We showed how to fold a piece of paper and punch one hole
  on given $n$ points
  so as to produce any desired patterns of holds.
  There is $4$ variants of problems;
  the paper is finite or infinite
  and we allow or forbid the crease on the points.
  In~[7], we gave solutions for each case and the order of crease
  are bounded on the polynomial order of $n$ and the paper ratio
  $r$.
  In the sequel paper~[4], we also gave a definition of
  the complexity of folds, which
  will be useful for further studies that determine
  NP-hardness of complex folding problems.
  \item {\bf Control model for traffic lights~[8]} \\
  This is a joint work with Xinchi Huang (UTokyo).
  We worked on discrete model of traffic lights which would not
  cause traffic jams.
  An observation data showed each number of cars for the pair of
  inlet and outlet of roads but there was ambiguity of
  the route of each cars.
  We let the problem come to
  $n$-varieties transportation problem but it is known as
  NP-complete. Therefore we also suggested an algorithm
  that superimpose usual max flow problems.
  \item {\bf Application of SAT-solver for AI} \\
